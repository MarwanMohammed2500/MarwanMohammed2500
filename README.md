We are heading towards a very automated life, might be good, might be *horribly* bad, but both ways, we're heading there -well...unless some universal crisis occur-, so why not try to make it the best step humanity took?

But to do that, we need to learn. Learn about ourselves, and about our past, but we also must learn about the tech we're using and inventing all the time to get to the future.

learning, in my opinion, is like a videogame skill-tree; you spend some points (time and effort) to learn a new skill, once that is done, the skill is yours, what makes learning in real life great though is two things:
1) You can learn from various sources, like video/onsite courses, books (my all-time favorite), and of course, other people.
2) You can improve that skill you gain the more you use it, if you keep an open mind and understand you don't know everything.

A big part of why I'm studying intelligent systems is the fact that it mixes between a variety of fields, like electronics, robotics, AI, IoT, and a few other stuff all of which I adore and very much am interested in, and that I can innovate in it as well, add more meaning to it, or make it *define* awesomeness.

I'm alwas happy to talk and have a nice chat, so hit me up and we can talk about a lot of things :D
